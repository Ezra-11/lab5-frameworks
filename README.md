This lab demonstrates the use of three popular UI frameworks: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React.js. In the Bootstrap section, I created a responsive layout with a navbar, two columns, a button, and an alert using only Bootstrap components. The Tailwind CSS section includes a responsive card layout styled entirely with utility-first classes from the Tailwind CDN. In the React.js section, I built a functional component that displays a personalized welcome message and toggles a message using useState. This lab helped me understand the differences between component-based and utility-first design, and how React simplifies DOM manipulation.
